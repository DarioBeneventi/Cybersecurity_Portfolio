# What is Splunk?

[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) is one of the leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions in the market. It offers powerful capabilities to collect, analyze, and correlate network and machine logs in real-time, making it an essential tool in the cybersecurity and IT operations domains.

## Splunk's Different Components

### Splunk Forwarder

Splunk Forwarder is a lightweight agent designed to be installed on endpoints that need monitoring. Its primary task is to collect data and send it to the central Splunk instance. Splunk Forwarders can collect data from various sources, including:

- Web traffic generated by a webserver.
- Windows Event Logs, Powershell data, and Sysmon data.
- Linux host-centric logs located in `/var/log/...`.
- Database connection requests, responses, and errors.

### Splunk Indexer

The Splunk Indexer plays a crucial role in processing the data received from the forwarders. It takes the data, normalizes it into field-value pairs, determines data types, and stores them as events. This indexing process makes it easier to search and analyze the data efficiently.

### Search Head

The Search Head is the central place within Splunk's Search & Reporting App where users can search and explore the indexed logs. Users can search for specific terms or use the Splunk Search Processing Language (SSPL) for more advanced queries. The Search Head also provides the ability to transform search results into tables, visualizations, and various chart formats.

Splunk's Search & Reporting App includes features such as analytics, datasets, reports, alerts, and dashboards, providing a comprehensive platform for data analysis and visualization.

### Splunk Dashboard

The Splunk Dashboard serves as the default home screen for users. It features the "Splunk Bar," where system-level messages (Messages), configuration options (Settings), job progress tracking (Activity), tutorials and documentation (Help), and a powerful search feature (Find) are available.

On the left side of the Dashboard, you'll find the "Apps Panel," listing the apps installed for your Splunk instance, extending its functionality.

In the middle of the Dashboard, you'll find the "Explore Splunk" section, which provides quick links to add data to your Splunk instance, install new Splunk apps, and access Splunk's documentation.
